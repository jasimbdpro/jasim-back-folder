BRIEF DESCRIPTION
=================

Barnamala is a an extremely user-friendly software for typing Bengali on your computer, using the keyboard on any Windows machine.  The words are typed in English as they are "pronounced".  For example, you would type "k a m a l" (excluding the quotations and the spaces), to generate the corresponding three-letter Bengali word (kaw-maw-law) in the Bengali AdarshaLipi font.  You can print out a whole document written in Bengali from within Barnamala.  Registered users will also be able to copy and paste the written Bengali text to all other Windows programs (including MS Word) where TrueType fonts can be used.


FEATURES OF BARNAMALA
=====================

Please see the web page http://www.pastelshade.com/barnamala/features/index.html for details on the features of Barnamala.

SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
===================

Barnamala works only on computers with Windows operating systems (Win 95/98/Me/NT/2000/XP). The following minimum configuration is recommended: 

Pentium processor with 32 MB RAM 
5 MB hard disk space 
SVGA display 


OVERVIEW OF THE INSTALLATION PROCESS
===================================

1.  If you do not have the AdarshaLipi font family installed on your Windows computer, you will need to install that first.  

	Download the AdarshaLipi font series from http://www.pastelshade.com/barnamala/download/index.html and follow the installation procedure provided there. The section "AdarshaLipi Font Installation" below also describes the process of installing the font set.

2.  Unzip (i.e., decompress) the barna201.zip or the barna201.exe file in its own folder (or subdirectory), such as C:\Barnamala). 

	If you have a previous version of Barnamala, you may wish to install the new version either in the same folder as the older version (in which case you will have replaced the older version by the new one).  If you older version was registered, the new version will pick up the registration from the older version.  However, the older version will not be available any longer.

	You may also unzip the new version to its own own folder.  In such a case, the new version will continue to act as an evaluation version.  When you are ready to replace the older version with the new, simply move all the files from the new folder to the old folder.  Alternatively, delete the new folder and unzip the distribution file (barna201.zip or barna201.exe) to the old folder.

3. Create a shortcut for the Barnamala program and place it on your Windows desktop.

	In Windows Explorer, navigate to the folder in which you unzipped all the files.  Right-click (i.e., click the right mouse button after putting your mouse cursor on) the "barnamala.exe" file.  Choose "Create Shortcut" from the menu that opens up.  This will create a new shortcut file ("Shortcut to Barnamala.exe") in the same folder.  Drag that shortcut file out on to the desk top.

You will now be able to run Barnamala by clicking on the shortcut.

(4) Double click on the file name 'install.exe'.

	This should automatically install the fonts on your Windows machine. The program may ask you to Restart Windows or reboot your machine. Please choose OK when you are asked to do so. If the program does not ask you for that, please restart the computer manually, after the install.exe program has finished running.
